## Description ##

Parking Finder is a Ruby on Rails app created in order to help people to find a parking space in London.

The app at the moment is capable of letting sellers to list their parking spaces for sale while it allows them to receive funds for their payments. 

Furthermore, buyers can browse the available parking spaces for sale where they can purchase them online by using their credit card.

Finally, both sellers and buyers can use the parking finder navigation system where they can find the available paid parking places for rent in the city of London.
